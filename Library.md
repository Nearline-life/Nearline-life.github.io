Entertainment comes in many forms, while i'm getting set up for video.. i should wrangle something like a library

I don't believe my books should be all physical, as that's limiting.

I'll use CAlibre for my digital library, but where do i get new books?

Well [project gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) has quite a few books, and they publish their indexes..
so a queue and download system is needed, this is still being [developed](https://github.com/Nearline-life/bookshelf)

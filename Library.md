Entertainment comes in many forms, while i'm getting set up for video.. i should wrangle something like a library

I don't believe my books should be all physical, as that's limiting.

I'll use CAlibre for my digital library, but where do i get new books?

Well [project gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) has quite a few books, and they publish their indexes..
so a queue and download system is needed, this is still being [developed](https://github.com/Nearline-life/bookshelf)

#Wikipedia 
has [kiwix](https://kiwix.org/en/), a neat offline server for packaged websites, just need to write an updater to pull the latest version on data day.
and learn the tools to pull my own sites, in the mean time i'll use [their online system.](https://zimit.kiwix.org/)

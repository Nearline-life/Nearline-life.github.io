to keep my computer running, i'll need a modern os.. and system updates.
Guess that means i'll need a cache
## OS
gonna have to be a linux.. my preferred choice is debian, as they still do disc based distributions.. sorta...
they disassemble the iso's into unique data and a list of references to mirrors.
you can also reference a faster mirror for faster downloads.. neat.

here's how i do it.

## Updates
For now i'll use the official updates repo, but there may become a time when i have to create a caching mirror of some kind

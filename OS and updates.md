to keep my computer running, i'll need a modern os.. and system updates.
Guess that means i'll need a cache
## OS
gonna have to be a linux.. my preferred choice is debian, as they still do disc based distributions.. sorta...
they disassemble the iso's into unique data and a list of references to mirrors.
you can also reference a faster mirror for faster downloads.. neat.
## Cache

here's how i do it.

### update success
debian 12.6 released its updates, and the update dvds were pulled down and integrated into my repo..
An apt update noticed the change in my repo package, which once upgraded, pulled the 3 update disc repoaitories into the system.

with the way debian do update discs, i think i've already got a good chunk of 12.7, jigdo will prove if that's true or not.

## Updates
For now i'll use the official updates repo, but there may become a time when i have to create a caching mirror of some kind

identify my bandwidth use and find a way to cut it off, or find a way to parcel it up.

# Data Day
i'm going to need bandwidth to participate in modern society... that ain't cool.. so i'll limit myself to 24 hrs of having bandwidth.
This can be friday night, and my systems can sync over night

## Data hour.
an additional hour of data can be applied every day to perform a smaller sync to ensure email and messenging keeps flowing

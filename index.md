# Beginning

As a geek of some many odd years, i've been using the internet for a while. 

I wasn't there at the start, I came to find the net shortly after the eternal september started.

At first it seemed amasing, watching it change and evolve from a novelty to an expectation and entangling into our lives and seemingly irrevokable.
